- Concatenated where possible
- Documented in this file

## Placeholder Structure

Events will follow the same concatenation patterns as Homepage:
- Auth actions → Single event with `action_type` property
- Profile updates → Single event with `action_type` property
- Account management → Single event with `action_type` property
