**Platform**: Web  
**Status**: ⏳ **PLACEHOLDER - Awaiting new design scan**  
**Date**: 2025-01-27

## Status

This page has not been scanned from the new Figma design yet. This file is a placeholder.

When the Checkout page is scanned, events will be:
- Extracted from Figma design
- Concatenated where possible
- Documented in this file

## Placeholder Structure

Events will follow the same concatenation patterns as Homepage:
- Cart item actions → Single event with `action_type` property
- Checkout steps → Single event with `step_number` property
- Payment methods → Single event with `payment_method` property
