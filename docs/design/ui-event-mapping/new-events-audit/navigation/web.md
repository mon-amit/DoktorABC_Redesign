**Platform**: Web  
**Status**: ⏳ **PLACEHOLDER - Awaiting new design scan**  
**Date**: 2025-01-27

## Status

This page has not been scanned from the new Figma design yet. This file is a placeholder.

When Navigation is scanned, events will be:
- Extracted from Figma design
- Concatenated where possible
- Documented in this file

## Placeholder Structure

Events will follow the same concatenation patterns as Homepage:
- Menu items → Single event with `nav_item` property
- Footer links → Single event with `footer_link` property
- Header actions → Single event with `action_type` property
