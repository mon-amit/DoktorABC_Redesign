- Documented in this file

## Placeholder Structure

Events will follow the same concatenation patterns as Homepage:
- Variant selections → Single event with `variant_id` property
- Quantity changes → Single event with `action` property
- Image clicks → Single event with `image_type` property
- Tab clicks → Single event with `tab_name` property
