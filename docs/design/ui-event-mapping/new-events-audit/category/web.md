## Status

This page has not been scanned from the new Figma design yet. This file is a placeholder.

When the Category page is scanned, events will be:
- Extracted from Figma design
- Concatenated where possible
- Documented in this file

## Placeholder Structure

Events will follow the same concatenation patterns as Homepage:
- Filter clicks → Single event with `filter_type` property
- Sort options → Single event with `sort_type` property
- Product cards → Single event with `product_id` and `position` properties
- Pagination → Single event with `pagination_action` property
